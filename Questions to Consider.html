  <h1>Questions to Consider</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Can I detect any strange developments in the days leading up to the Palisades Fire?</li>
    <li>Is the soil and vegetation in the forest considered at-risk of a fire beforehand? What could be done to mitigate these risks if they do exist?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sustainable Development Goals</h2>
  <p>
    Two of the 17 SDGs are at the heart of what this project could provide: SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).
    Sustainable Development Goal 13 is to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” while SDG 15 aims to “protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.”
